This guide walks you through the process of configuring a web application form to support
validation.

== What You Will Build

You will build a simple Spring MVC application that takes user input and checks the input
by using standard validation annotations. You will also see how to display the error
message on the screen so that the user can re-enter input to make it be valid.

== What You Need

:java_version: 1.8

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=validating-form-input&name=validating-form-input&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.validating-form-input&dependencies=web,thymeleaf,validation[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web*, *Thymeleaf*, and *Validation*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Create a `PersonForm` Object

The application involves validating a user's name and age, so you first need to create a
class that backs the form used to create a person. The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/PersonForm.java`) shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/PersonForm.java[]
----
====

The `PersonForm` class has two attributes: `name` and `age`. It is flagged with a few
standard validation annotations:

- `@Size(min=2, max=30)`: Allows names between 2 and 30 characters long.
- `@NotNull`: Does not allow a null value, which is what Spring MVC generates if the entry
is empty.
- `@Min(18)`: Does not allow the age to be less than 18.

In addition to that, you can also see getters and setters for `name` and `age` and a
convenient `toString()` method.

== Create a Web Controller

Now that you have defined a form-backing object, it is time to create a simple web
controller. The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/WebController.java`) shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/WebController.java[]
----
====

This controller has a GET method and a POST method. Both methods are mapped to `/`.

The `showForm` method returns the `form` template. It includes a `PersonForm` in its
method signature so that the template can associate form attributes with a `PersonForm`.

The `checkPersonInfo` method accepts two arguments:

- A `personForm` object marked with `@Valid` to gather the attributes filled out in the
form.
- A `bindingResult` object so that you can test for and retrieve validation errors.

You can retrieve all the attributes from the form, which is bound to the `PersonForm`
object. In the code, you test for errors. If you encounter an error, you can send the user
back to the original `form` template. In that situation, all the error attributes are
displayed.

If all of the person's attribute are valid, it redirects the browser to the final
`results` template.

== Build an HTML Front End

Now build the "`main`" page, as the following listing (from
`src/main/resources/templates/form.html`) shows:

====
[source,html]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/templates/form.html[]
----
====

The page contains a simple form, with each of its field in a separate cell in a table. The
form is geared to post to `/`. It is marked as being backed up by the `personForm`
object that you saw in the `GET` method in the web controller. This is known as a
"`bean-backed form`". There are two fields in the `PersonForm` bean, and you can see that
they are tagged with `th:field="pass:[*]{name}"` and `th:field="pass:[*]{age}"`. Next to each field is a
secondary element that is used to show any validation errors.

Finally, you have a button that submits the form. In general, if the user enters a name or
age that violates the `@Valid` constraints, it bounces back to this page with the error
message displayed. If a valid name and age is entered, the user is routed to the next web
page.

The following example (from `src/main/resources/templates/results.html`) shows the results
page:

====
[source,html]
----
include::complete/src/main/resources/templates/results.html[]
----
====

NOTE: In this simple example, these web pages do not have any sophisticated CSS or
JavaScript.

== Run the Application

For this application, you are using the template language of
https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/thymeleafspring.html[Thymeleaf]. This
application needs more than raw HTML. The Spring Initializr created an application class
for you. The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/ValidatingFormInputApplication.java`) shows
that class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/validatingforminput/ValidatingFormInputApplication.java[]
----
====

To activate Spring MVC, you would normally add `@EnableWebMvc` to the `Application` class.
But Spring Boot's `@SpringBootApplication` already adds this annotation when it detects
`spring-webmvc` on your classpath. This same annotation lets it find the annotated
`@Controller` class and its methods.

The Thymeleaf configuration is also taken care of by `@SpringBootApplication`. By default,
templates are located in the classpath under `templates/` and are resolved as views by
stripping the '.html' suffix off the file name. (Thymeleaf settings can be changed and
overridden in a variety of ways, depending on what you need to achieve, but the details
are not relevant to this guide.)

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

The application should be up and running within a few seconds.

If you visit `http://localhost:8080/`, you should see something like the following image:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/gs-validating-form-input/main/images/valid-01.png[]

The following pair of images show what happens if you enter `N` for the name and `15` for
your age and click on *Submit*:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/gs-validating-form-input/main/images/valid-03.png[]

The preceding images show that, because the values violated the constraints in the
`PersonForm` class, you get bounced back to the "`main`" page. Note that, if you click on
*Submit* with nothing in the entry box, you get a different error, as the following image
shows:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/gs-validating-form-input/main/images/valid-04.png[]

If you enter a valid name and age, you end up on the `results` page, as the following
image shows:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/gs-validating-form-input/main/images/valid-05.png[]

== Summary

Congratulations! You have coded a simple web application with validation built into a
domain object. This way, you can ensure that the data meets certain criteria and that the
user correctly inputs the data.
